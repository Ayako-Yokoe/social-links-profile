## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

To make the list items span the entire width of the card, I added width: 100% to both the <ul> and <li> elements, along with display: block for the <li> to ensure proper layout.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
ul {
  width: 100%;
  ...;
}

li {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  ...;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning more about setting width properties and optimizing layout techniques.
